# Exercise 1 - Up-to-date or Behind

Alex is taking a bioinformatics class and in each week he can be either up-to-date or he may have fallen behind. If he is up-to-date in a given week, the probability that he will be up-to-date in the next week is 0.75. If he is behind in the given week, the probability that he will be up-to-date in the next week is 0.5.

If we assume that these probabilities do not depend on whether he was up-to-date or behind in previous weeks, we can model the problem using a Markov chain.




### 1a)

Draw a Markov chain that models the states of being Up-to-date or behind

### 1b)

Assume Alex is up-to-date in the first class; what is the probability that he is up-to-date two classes later?

##### Hint : Formulae

\begin{align}
  \pi(0) &: initial\ probabilities\\
  P&: transition\ matrix\\
  \pi(t) &= \pi(0) * P^{t}
\end{align}
  
  

##### Solution

The Probability is 0.6875

\begin{align}
  \pi(0) &= 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & 0
  \end{pmatrix}\\
  \\
  P &= 
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0.75 & 0.25\\
    0.5 & 0.5

  \\
  \pi(2) &= \pi(0) \times P^{2}\\

##### Hint : Formulae

The Probability is 1/3


$$

  \begin{pmatrix}
    2/3 & 1/3

# Exercise 2 - Stationary distribution

    0.339 & 0.371 & 0.290\\
    0.339 & 0.371 & 0.290

  \lim \limits_{t \to \infty} \pi(t) &= \
  \begin{pmatrix}
    0.339 & 0.371 & 0.290

 is independent of $\pi(0)$ as long as $P$ does not contain disconnected subgraphs and only if the limit exists.

# Exercise 3 - Reversibility



Consider a three-state Markov chain having the following transition probability matrix

$$

  0 & 1 & 0 \\
  \dfrac{1}{3} & 0 & \dfrac{2}{3}\\

### 3b)

Given the stationary distribution $\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{1}{6} & \dfrac{1}{2} & \dfrac{1}{3} \end{pmatrix}$,
is this Markov chain reversible and what does this property tell you?

#### {.tabset} 

##### Hide

##### Hint

A markov chain is reversible if:

$$
\pi_i^{*}P_{i,j} = \pi_j^{*}P_{j,i}
$$

Easiest way is to calculate it for all pairs of $i$ and $j$


##### Solution

Because $\pi_i^{*}P_{i,j} = \pi_j^{*}P_{j,i}\ \forall\ i,j$ the Markov chain is reversible


\begin{align}
  \pi^{ * }_1 P_{1,2} &=& \dfrac{1}{6} \times 1 &=& \dfrac{1}{6} &=& \dfrac{1}{2} \times \dfrac{1}{3} &=& \pi^{ * }_2 P_{2,1}\\
  \pi^{ * }_1 P_{1,3} &=& \dfrac{1}{6} \times 0 &=& 0 &=& \dfrac{1}{3} \times 0 &=& \pi^{ * }_3 P_{3,1}\\
  \pi^{ * }_2 P_{2,3} &=& \dfrac{1}{2} \times \dfrac{2}{3}  &=& \dfrac{1}{3} &=& \dfrac{1}{3} \times 1 &=& \pi^{ * }_3 P_{3,2}
