# Exercise 2 - DNA and RNA
The genetic information of an organism is stored in the DNA in the form of a code. This code consists of four building blocks or bases (`A` for adenine, `C` for cytosine, `G` for guanine, `T` for thymine). These bases or nucleotides follow each other in a certain sequence, e.g.:
```
AGTCGTAATTGGCCCCAATTGCAAAAA
```

A single hereditary unit consists of a subsequence of DNA (called a gene), which contains the information to build a functional RNA or protein molecule.

### 2a)

::: {.question data-latex=""}

Match these terms to the correct number in the figure below: adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, uracil, phosphate, deoxyribose, hydrogen bond, backbone, and bases.

:::


#### {.tabset}

##### Hide




##### Hint: Possible Answers

- [ ] The order is based on the numbering of the carbons in the sugar of the nucleic acid
- [ ] The order is based on the numbering of the carbons in the phosphate of the nucleic acid
- [ ] The order was arbitrarily chosen by the discoverer of RNA


##### Solution

- [x] The order is based on the numbering of the carbons in the sugar of the nucleic acid
- [ ] The order is based on the numbering of the carbons in the phosphate of the nucleic acid
- [ ] The order was arbitrarily chosen by the discoverer of RNA

```
**Note**
:::
::: {#note-exp .note-body}


The carbon-atoms in the sugar of the nucleic acid are numbered from 1 to 5.
In the phosphate-sugar backbone, C5 and C4 are the carbon atoms that connect
to the phosphate group so that 5' denotes the end of the chain where C5 is the closest
and 3' denotes the ed where C3 is the closest.
