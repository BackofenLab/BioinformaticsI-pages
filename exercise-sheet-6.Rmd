# Exercise 1 - The genetic code

The standard genetic code  describes how 64 possible codons encode 20 amino
acids and the stop translation signal. It enables DNA-encoded mRNA to be translated into amino acid sequences
and is common to all living organisms on Earth.

**Note**

::: {#note-exp .note-body}

Above you can see the RNA codon table (or "Code-Sonne"). It can be used to translate a sequence of
nucleotide triplets into a sequence of amino acids. The tabe is read from the inside to the outside.
e.g. the triplet `AUG` would translate to Methionine (the start codon).

# Exercise 3 - What are enzymes?

Enzymes are important molecules because they can substantially speed up chemical 
reactions and enhance their specificity. They are sometimes referred to as 
biocatalysts. Catalysts are compounds that influence chemical reactions 
being used up as a result. In other words, they are reusable. A single enzyme 
molecule processes about 100.000 to 5 million molecules every minute.

Shortly explain the function of the further mentioned enzymes regarding their role in 
prokaryotic translation or transcription

#### {.tabset}

##### Solution

### 3c)

RNA Polymerase


#### {.tabset}

##### Hide


##### Solution

RNA Polymerases are enzymes responsible for copying a DNA sequence into an

### 3d)

RNAse H


#### {.tabset}

### 3e)

DNA Helicase


#### {.tabset}

##### Solution

DNA Helicases are enzymes that are able to unwind DNA by the use of the 
energy-equivalent ATP. They play essential roles in DNA replication, DNA repair, and DNA recombination in all organisms.

# Exercise 4 - The RCSB Protein Database - PDB

Protein structures are hard to resolve. Therefore, identified protein structures 
are stored in according databases to enable a fast access and to gather all 
data associated. An example is the RCSB Protein Data Base (PDB).
